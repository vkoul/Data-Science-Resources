# Data Science Resource List 

Learning new things has become more accesible now due to the plethora of material available online. This is particularly the case for Data Science and Machine Learning. Since I got interested in the field, I have come across a huge amount of learning material which I found immensely useful. This is an attempt to put them togther and make it accesible to others.    
There are many wonderful resources which Professors have put up online and this is an attempt to catalogue these awesome resources. It also has been done by Prakhar on[`Github`](https://github.com/prakhar1989/awesome-courses), which is suited to `Software Engineering`, so the below list is an attempt to list down resources  pertaining to `Data Science` and focussed more on `R` software language. I plan to add more Python Material going forward. 

Hope you find this list useful.

[PROB 140](http://prob140.org/) **Probability for Data Science** *UC- Berkeley* :memo: :book: :computer:

* Prob 140 (formally Statistics 140 or STAT 140) is a probability course for undergraduates who have taken Data 8, have a math background, and wish to go deeper into the theory of data science.
The emphasis on simulation and the bootstrap in Data 8 gives students a concrete sense of randomness and sampling variability. Prob 140 will capitalize on this. Because of the students’ backgrounds, Prob 140 will move swiftly over basics, avoid approximations that are unnecessary when SciPy is at hand, and replace some of the routine calculus by symbolic math done in SymPy. This will create time to focus on the more demanding concepts that are part of the theoretical foundations of data science.

*  Not all data lives in nice, clean spreadsheets, not all data fits in a computer’s main memory. As statisticians we cannot always rely on other people and sciences to get the data into formats that we can deal with: we will discuss aspects of statistical computing as they are relevant for data analysis. Read and work with data in different formats: flat files, databases, web technologies. Elements of literate programming help us with making our workflow transparent and analyses reproducible. We will discuss communication of results in form of R packages and interactive web application.

* Computational data analysis is an essential part of modern statistics. Competent statisticians must not just be able to run existing programs, but to understand the principles on which they work. They must also be able to read, modify, and write code, so that they can assemble the computational tools needed to solve their data analysis problems, rather than distorting problems to fit tools provided by others.

[CME 252](http://bit.ly/2EmjyLe) **Introduction to Optimization** *Stanford University* :memo: :book: :computer:

*  This course introduces mathematical optimization and modeling, with a focus on convex optimization. Topics include: varieties of mathematical optimization, convexity of functions and sets, convex optimization modeling with CVXPY, gradient descent and basic distributed optimization, in-depth examples from machine learning, statistics and other fields and applications of bi-convexity and non-convex gradient descent.

[CSC 321](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~rgrosse/courses/csc321_2018/) **Intro to Neural Networks and Machine Learning** *University of Toronto* :memo: :book: :computer:
* This course gives an overview of both the foundational ideas and the recent advances in neural net algorithms. Roughly the first 2/3 of the course focuses on supervised learning -- training the network to produce a specified behavior when one has lots of labeled examples of that behavior. The last 1/3 focuses on unsupervised learning and reinforcement learning..

[CIS 419/519](https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cis519/spring2018/index.html) **Applied Machine Learning- Spring 2018** *UPenn Engineering* :memo: :book: :computer:

This course will introduce some of the key machine learning methods that have proved valuable and successful in practical applications. We will discuss some of the foundational questions in machine learning in order to get a good understanding of the basic issues in this area, and present the main paradigms and techniques needed to obtain successful performance in application areas such as natural language and text understanding, speech recognition, computer vision, data mining, adaptive computer systems and others. The main body of the course will review several supervised and (semi/un)supervised learning approaches. These include methods for learning linear representations, decision-tree methods, Bayesian methods, kernel based methods and neural networks methods, as well as clustering, dimensionality reduction and reinforcement learning methods.
